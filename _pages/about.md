I am a **Postdoctoral Investigator** in the Biology Department at the **Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution** working with [Heidi Sosik](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/hsosik/) and [Michael Neubert](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mneubert/). Prior to this position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Santa Cruz with [Stephan Munch](https://sbmunch.sites.ucsc.edu) and [Eric Palkovacs](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu). I obtained a PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from MIT under the supervision of [Serguei Saavedra](https://sites.google.com/site/sergueisaavedra/). I am originally from Brazil, where I obtained a Master's degree in Ecology from the University of São Paulo under the supervision of [Paulo Guimarães Jr.](http://guimaraeslab.weebly.com/) as well as Bachelor's degrees in Biology and in Applied Mathematics. For more information, please see my [CV](https://lucaspdmedeiros.github.io/files/Medeiros_CV.pdf).

The main focus of my research is to understand and predict how ecological communities of interacting species respond to natural and human-driven perturbations. To do so, I develop approaches based on population dynamics models, dynamical systems theory, nonlinear time-series analysis, and machine learning to unravel how communities may respond to disturbances such as warming, heatwaves, storms, pollution, or overfishing. I am particularly interested in mathematical and computational approaches that allow us to anticipate how a community might respond to future disturbances by learning about its dynamical behavior from past empirical data. I am currently applying these data-driven approaches to marine ecosystems, such as the planktonic communities extensively monitored through the Northeast US Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project ([NES-LTER](https://nes-lter.whoi.edu)). In addition to this main line of research, I am also very interested in several related topics that include: (1) the causes and consequences of non-equilibrium (e.g., cycles, chaos) population dynamics, (2) structural stability approaches to understand changes in community composition over time, and (3) nonlinear time-series approaches to forecast and manage harvested populations.

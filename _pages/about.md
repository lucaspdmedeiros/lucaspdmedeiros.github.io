Olá! My name is **Lucas P. Medeiros** and I am a 4-year PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT under the supervision of [**Prof. Serguei Saavedra**](https://sites.google.com/site/sergueisaavedra/). I am also a 2021-2022 [**Martin Fellow for Sustainability**](https://martin-fellows.mit.edu/).

I am originally from Brazil and received a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at the University of São Paulo (USP). I also received a Master's in Ecology at USP under the supervision of [**Prof. Paulo R. Guimarães Jr.**](http://guimaraeslab.weebly.com/).

My PhD research focuses on understanding and quantifying how ecological communities and their constituent species respond to different types of perturbation. I have used both model-driven (e.g., Lotka-Volterra population dynamics model) and data-driven (e.g., empirical dynamic modeling, time series analysis) theoretical approaches as well as different empirical data sets to address this problem. Check out the [Research](https://lucaspdmedeiros.github.io/_pages/Research) and [Publications](https://lucaspdmedeiros.github.io/_pages/Publications) pages or get in contact if you would like to know more about my research!

I am a **Postdoctoral Investigator** in the Biology Department at the **Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution** working with [Heidi Sosik](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/hsosik/) and [Michael Neubert](https://www.whoi.edu/profile/mneubert/). Prior to this position, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries with [Stephan Munch](https://sbmunch.sites.ucsc.edu) and [Eric Palkovacs](https://palkovacs.eeb.ucsc.edu). I obtained a PhD degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from MIT under the supervision of [Serguei Saavedra](https://sites.google.com/site/sergueisaavedra/). I am originally from Brazil, where I obtained a Master's degree in Ecology from the University of São Paulo (USP) under the supervision of [Paulo R. Guimarães Jr.](http://guimaraeslab.weebly.com/) as well as Bachelor's degrees in Biology and in Applied Mathematics. For more information, please see my [CV](https://lucaspdmedeiros.github.io/files/Medeiros_CV.pdf).

My research revolves around understanding and predicting how ecological communities, especially from the marine environment, respond to natural and human-driven perturbations. To do so, I develop approaches based on population dynamics, dynamical systems theory, and nonlinear time-series analysis to unravel how communities may respond to disturbances such as warming, pollution, or overfishing. I am particularly interested in mathematical and computational approaches that allow us to anticipate how a community might respond to future disturbances by learning about its dynamical behavior from past population time-series data. I am currently applying such approaches to marine planktonic communities using data from the Northeast US Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research project ([NES-LTER](https://nes-lter.whoi.edu)). In addition to this main line of research, I am also interested in several related topics that include: nonlinear time-series approaches to forecast and manage fished populations and structural stability approaches to understand changes in community composition over time.

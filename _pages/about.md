Olá! My name is **Lucas P. Medeiros** and I am a 4th-year PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT under the supervision of [**Prof. Serguei Saavedra**](https://sites.google.com/site/sergueisaavedra/). I am also a 2021-2022 [**Martin Fellow for Sustainability**](https://martin-fellows.mit.edu/) at MIT.

I am originally from Brazil and received a B.S. in Biology and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of São Paulo (USP). I also obtained a Master's in Ecology from USP under the supervision of [**Prof. Paulo R. Guimarães Jr.**](http://guimaraeslab.weebly.com/).

The main goal of my PhD research is to improve our understanding and measurement of how ecological communities and their constituent species respond to different types of perturbations. To address this problem, I develop both model-driven (e.g., Lotka-Volterra population dynamics model) and data-driven (e.g., empirical dynamic modeling, time series analysis) theoretical approaches and apply these approaches to empirical data. My hope is that this research can be applied to better conserve and manage ecological communities in the face of stronger and more frequent human-driven perturbations.

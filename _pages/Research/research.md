### Ecological resilience: from whole communities to individual species

Ecological communities are frequently perturbed through both natural and human-driven impacts. In order to avoid the loss of biodiversity and of ecosystem services, it is crucial to properly understand and measure how communities will respond to such perturbations. My collaborators and I have contributed to addressing this problem in two different ways. First, using a model-driven approach (Lotka-Volterra population dynamics model), we have shown that recovery from perturbations that affect species abundances and resistance to perturbations that affect model parameters can provide similar information about the resilience of a community ([Medeiros *et al* 2021 *Journal of Animal Ecology*](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13421)). Second, using a data-driven approach (empirical dynamic modeling), we have developed a method to detect which species in a community are the most sensitive to perturbations on abundances when population dynamics are out of equilibrium (Medeiros *et al* 2021 *Under review*).

### Understanding changes in the species composition of ecological communities

A longstanding problem in ecology is to understand whether some changes in species composition can be more likely and predictable than others. My collaborators and I have used a structural stability approach to show that species combinations that can tolerate a larger range of environmental conditions (i.e., larger range of model parameters) are more likely to be observed in nature ([Medeiros *et al* 2021 *The American Naturalist*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/711663)). We have also shown that this structural stability approach allows us to accurately forecast the individual species that are more likely to be observed when we do not know the final community composition ([Saavedra *et al* 2020 *Ecology Letters*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.13582)).

### Coevolution in networks of interacting species

Although coevolution between pairs of interacting species has been studied for decades, recent studies have began to address how coevolution operates in large networks of interacting species. I explored this problem in my Master's research. Using a trait evolution model and information on several empirical mutualistic networks, my collaborators and I have shown that gene flow has the potential to increase trait matching between interacting species ([Medeiros *et al* 2018 *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/47/12017)).
